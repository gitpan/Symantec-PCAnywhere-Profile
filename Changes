        License changed to public domain; I don't really have the right to
        claim copyright on this, since it's mostly public domain code from
        Stephen Friedl. Cleaned up (rebuilt) distribution to improve module
        Kwalitee. Merged Symantec::PCAnywhere::Profile::CHF.

        Moving to Module::Install. Trying to make CPANTS happy. Merging code
        from my other unorganized sources (including support for CIF) and
        cleaning things up.
